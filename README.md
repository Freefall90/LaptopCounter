An "accident counter" LED clock for a coworker who regularly leaves his laptop at home

We have this guy at work who will leave his computer at home pretty regularly. We got to joking about needing one of those LED "days since last accident" displays in the office. So I set about to create one.

It will count up to 999 days, can be manually set by rotating the dial, and reset by pushing the dial.

Oh yeah, the code and circuitry depends on having this LED clock screen I salvaged with some really weird common anode setup. So, it's probably not all that reusable. Sorry.
